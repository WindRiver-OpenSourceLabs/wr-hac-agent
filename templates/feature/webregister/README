Helix App Cloud Web UI Target Registration

This is a optional component for Helix App Cloud.  It installs the
web pages, scripts, and cgi scripts to enable users to associate the
board it runs on with a device in their Helix App Cloud workspace. It
has been tested with lightppd; however, it should be relatively easy
to adapt for other servers.

It supports 3 methods to do this:

 1. User supplies their login credentials and a desired device name
    and the device appears in their workspace.
 2. User requests a PIN code which can then be used in the Helix App
    Cloud "New Device" workflow to create the device in his/her 
    workspace.
 3. User has a device already created and associates the board with 
    that device.

In order to use the Web UI you must also include the command 
like UI (feature/cmdlineregister).  See the README for the command
line UI for details.

To add the Web UI to your build, do the following:

 1. add wr-helix-agent to your --with-layer arguments on the configure 
    command line.
 2. Add feature/cmdlineregister AND featue/webregister to your 
    --with-feature arguement on the configure command line.
 3. After running configure, create projectDir/sdkName.txt, projectDir/
    sdkVersion.cfg.  You can also add the optional files projectDir/
    hacServer.cfg and projectDir/hacProxy.cfg.
 4. Build your image
