Helix App Cloud Command Line Target Registration

This is a optional component for Helix App Cloud.  It installs the
registerTarget command and supporting files.  registerTarget allows
users to associate the baord it runs on with a device in their Helix
App Cloud workspace.  It supports 3 methods to do this:

 1. User supplies their login credentials and a desired device name
    and the device appears in their workspace.
 2. User requests a PIN code which can then be used in the Helix App
    Cloud "New Device" workflow to create the device in his/her 
    workspace.
 3. User has a device already created and associates the board with 
    that device.

There are several files that should be present in the projectDir 
before building the Linux image.  They are:

 /etc/defaut/sdkName.txt - Contains the name of the Helix App Cloud
      SDK.  This is the same as the "key" value in the SDK config.json.
 /etc/default/sdkVersion.txt - Contains the version of the Helix
      App CLoud SDK.  This is the same as the "version" value in the 
      SDK config.json.
 /etc/default/hacServer.cfg - This is the FQDN or IP of the Helix App
      Cloud Server used when one isn't specified by the user.  If absent
      it will be set to "app.cloud.windriver.com" which will work for 
      99% of the use cases.
 /etc/default/hacProxy.cfg - Set to the URL of a HTTPS proxy server 
      so that the board can invoke REST services on the Helix APP CLoud
      server.  This is optional.  If there is one in projectDir it will
      be used; otherwize it is assumed it is not needed.

To add this to your build, do the following:

 1. add wr-helix-agent to your --with-layer arguments on the configure 
    command line.
 2. Add feature/cmdlineregister to your --with-feature arguement on 
    the configure command line.
 3. After running configure, create projectDir/sdkName.txt, projectDir/
    sdkVersion.cfg.  You can also add the optional files projectDir/
    hacServer.cfg and projectDir/hacProxy.cfg.
 4. Build your image
