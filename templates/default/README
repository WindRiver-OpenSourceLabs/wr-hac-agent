Helix App Cloud Agent

The Helix App Cloud Agent is the communication process that connects a 
board to a users Helix App Cloud workspace.  The service is called hac.service.  
It will start automatically at boot time.  If you wish to control it manually, 
these commands are available:

  systemctl stop hac.service
  systemctl restart hac.serice
  systemctl start hac.service

When hac.service starts, it reads the contenst of /etc/default/device_mgr.cfg
for parameters to contact the Helix App Cloud servers and associate the board
it is running on with a users worksace.

The location and name of device_mgr.cfg can be modified by setting the value
of device_mgr on the kernel bootline.  For example, to set it to a FAT 
paritition mounted on /boot you could use device_mgr=/boot/device_mgr.cfg.

 The executable for the Helix App Cloud Agent is /usr/sbin/device.  It can 
be invoked manually for debug purposes as follows:

1. Make sure hac.service is stopped (systemctl stop hac.service)
2. Run the service: /usr/sbin/device [args] file:/etc/default/device_mgr.cfg

For the list of arguments use -h.
